& - This operator allows you to run commands in the background of your terminal.
&& - This operator allows you to combine multiple commands together in one line of your terminal.
> - This operator is a redirector - meaning that we can take the output from a command (such as using cat to output a file) and direct it elsewhere.
>> This operator does the same function of the > operator but appends the output rather than replacing (meaning nothing is overwritten).
