***IDOR***
IDOR (INSECURE DIRECT OBJECT REFERENCE)

|| using unpredicted IDOR
an excellent method of IDOR detection is to create two accounts and swap the Id numbers between them. If you can view the other users' content using their Id number while still being logged in with a different account (or not logged in at all), you've found a valid IDOR vulnerability.

|| IDOR LOCATION
Sometimes endpoints could have an unreferenced parameter that may have been of some use during development and got pushed to production. For example, you may notice a call to /user/details displaying your user information (authenticated through your session). But through an attack known as parameter mining, you discover a parameter called user_id that you can use to display other users' information, for example, /user/details?user_id=123.
